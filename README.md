<h1>Welcome!</h1>

*About me*
<p>I am Andrea, nice to meet you. I am a Mechanical Engineering, graduated in 2020 at Politecnico di Milano. As I was completing my studies, I realized that I was enjoying code more and more. It was also the time ML and AI was starting to disrupting into university courses. I then decided to look for a thesis project which encluded bth Python and AI.</p>

<p>My Python journey started in 2020 and since then I have tried to explore its fundamentals and different aspects. My passion for coding has increased more and more and here you can find the courses I completed and some projects I have been working on in my freetime.
