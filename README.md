<h1>Welcome!</h1>

*About me*
<p>I am Andrea, nice to meet you. At the moment, I am working as R&D Engineer/Software developer at One-Off Innovatio srl, innovative startup at Polihub-Politecnico di Milano and part of One-Off Solution.
I describe myself as a curious-driven person, as in my work as in my freetime. I love nature in all its shades, but technology have always fascinated me. I love hiking, cinema, animals, travelling, sports, F1, reading and music.

<p>I graduated in Mechanical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano in 2020. As I was completing my studies, I realized that I was enjoying code more and more. It was also the time ML and AI was starting to disrupting into university courses. I then decided to look for a thesis project which encluded both Python and AI.</p>
Since then I have tried to explore its fundamentals and different aspects. My passion for coding has increased more and more and here you can find the courses I completed and some projects I have been working on in my freetime.

- OOP: Covers Object-Oriented Programming basics, providing foundational knowledge for working with classes. Currently exploring Development Patterns to enhance coding skills.
- Machine learning: Completed an Udemy course on scikit-learn.
- CNN: Meet Pablo and Luis, my dog and cat. Built a CNN for classifying their pictures, my initial attempt with TensorFlow. Planning to delve deeper in the future.
- Threading: Explores fundamentals of threading in Python.
- Django-crushcode: Includes user login, user registration, weather scanner, and chat (WIP) apps. More complex projects are on the horizon, most likely my personal website and an agenda platform for my father, who works as hairdresser.
